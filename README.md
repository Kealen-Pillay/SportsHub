# SportsHub
SportsHub is a React Native mobile application that aims to connect athletes all across New Zealand with each other through sporting events.
This application allows users to create, join, and view user-created teams and sporting events.
SportsHub enables users to communicate with each other in a public chatroom with real-time updates.
Finding sporting events is made easy, by allowing users to filter events by sports preferences.
The SportsHub application also provides a built-in dark / light mode toggle for both day and night usage.

## Implementation: 
- Uses Firebase authentication to store accounts.
- Uses Firebase's firestore database to store data.
- The application is developed using Javascript with the React Native framework.
- The project is initialized using Expo.

## How to build the project:
- Download the "Expo Go" app from the app store, available both on Android Google Play Store and the IOS App store.
- Type ```expo start``` into the terminal to build the project. This will open metro bundler and will provide a QR code to scan using either the camera app (IOS) or the Expo Go app (Android).
- (In the case that dependencies are missing from the project upon build, type ```npm ci``` to perform a clean installation of dependencies).
